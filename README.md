# NaughtsAndCrosses

This is a TicTacToe Game I have made within 3 hours. 

I have created a test project as well using xUnit to test the outcomes. There will be functionality missing from the project such as:

- Handling detection if the player has chosen a square that has already been chosen.
- Any size game boards.
- 3+ Player game.
- Custom Player Marker (As in using "A" instead of "O" or "X")
- Better congratulations message.
- Do you want to play again functionality.


If I was to spend more time I would add additional tests to take into account if the player chooses an already chosen square.
